# Tic-Tac-Toe (XO) Game with AI

## Description
This is a classic Tic-Tac-Toe (XO) game implemented in C++ with a graphical user interface using the Qt framework. The game features an AI opponent that uses the Minimax algorithm to determine its moves.

## Features
* Graphical User Interface using Qt.
* Player vs AI mode.
* AI opponent utilizing:
    * Minimax algorithm for decision making.
* Clear indication of game state (win, lose, draw).

## Technologies Used
* **Programming Language:** C++
* **GUI Framework:** Qt
* **AI Algorithms:** Minimax, Alpha-Beta Pruning

## Setup & Installation
1.  Create a Qt Widgets Application and copy then paste the main.cpp
2.  Ensure you have a compatible C++ compiler (like g++ or Clang) and the Qt development libraries installed.`

## How to Play
1.  Launch the application.
2.  The player ('O') clicks on an empty square to make a move.
3.  The AI opponent ('X') will automatically make its move.
